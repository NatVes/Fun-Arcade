        "fun-fact": "Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC. <br /> An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) and instead of having any number of pieces, each player had only three; thus, they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing.",

        "instruction": "Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid. <br /> Players take turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O') in empty cells of the grid. The first player starts with 'X', and then players alternate turns. <br /> The game ends when one player achieves a line of three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the grid is filled with no winner (a draw). <br /> Players aim to create their own lines while blocking their opponent's lines to prevent them from winning. The player who successfully forms a line first wins the game. <br /> After the game ends, players can choose to restart and play again."

        "fun-fact": "Grim Origins:  While the exact origins are unknown, many sources point to a Victorian-era (19th century) game called The Rite of Words and Life. This was a grim ordeal where a person facing the death penalty would be given a chance to guess a word chosen by the executioner. Each wrong guess would bring them closer to the actual hanging.<br />Tamer Transformation:  Luckily, the game evolved into a less deadly pastime.  The word-guessing focus remained, but instead of literal hanging, incorrect guesses led to drawing parts of the hangman stick figure.<br />Victorian Publications:  References to Hangman appear in late 19th century books, like Alice Gomme's  Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1894), where it was called Birds, Beasts, and Fishes. At this point, it didn't have the hanging imagery yet.<br />Modern Popularity: The version we know today, complete with the hangman drawing, gained widespread popularity in the 20th century.",
        "data-source": "Wikipedia",
        "source-link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)",
        "instruction": "Hangman is a guessing game for one or more players. One player, in this case the computer, thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses."
